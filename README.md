# Write a Data Science Blog Post
This Project contains on writing a blog post as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program, which can be read by following this link: https://sjuanandres0.medium.com/covid-19-countries-wealth-cases-deaths-and-vaccines-ff7fa8a83b1b

Additionally, you can take a look at the Jupyter Notebook by following this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sjuanandres0/covid19/blob/master/COVID-19_WealthCasesDeathsVaccines.ipynb \
(It contains plotly graphs which are not interactive when rendered in GitHub).

## Project Description

### Motivation
During the Covid-19 outbreak, lots of amazing dashboards were released - loved them all! \
However, I was particularly curious about how the wealth of a country affects the main indicators like the number of cases, deaths and vaccines. \
Hope this post helps you gain some insight on that as well!

### Dataset
The data used is open source facilitated by the team of Our World in Data. Special thanks to them!\
You will not find any data file in this repo because the code reads directly the data stored in [Our World in Data GitHub repo](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

### Questions
To begin with, I will state 3 main questions I will try to reply in this blog post:
1.	Do Wealthy countries have less cases?
2.	Do Wealthy countries have less deaths?
3.	Do Wealthy countries have more vaccines? Did they have them earlier?

## Code

### Requirements
1. Python3
2. Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno, Plotly (if you miss any, you can pip install them)

## Thanks!
