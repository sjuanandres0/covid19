# Write a Data Science Blog Post
This Project contains on writing a blog post as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program, which can be read by following this link: https://sjuanandres0.medium.com/covid-19-countries-wealth-cases-deaths-and-vaccines-ff7fa8a83b1b

Additionally, you can take a look at the Jupyter Notebook by following this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sjuanandres0/covid19/blob/master/COVID-19_WealthCasesDeathsVaccines.ipynb \
(It contains plotly graphs which are not interactive when rendered in GitHub).

## Project Description

### Motivation
During the Covid-19 outbreak, lots of amazing dashboards were released - loved them all! \
However, I was particularly curious about how the wealth of a country affects the main indicators like the number of cases, deaths and vaccines. \
Hope this post helps you gain some insight on that as well!

### Dataset
The data used is open source facilitated by the team of Our World in Data. Special thanks to them!\
You will not find any data file in this repo because the code reads directly the data stored in [Our World in Data GitHub repo](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

### Questions
To begin with, I will state 3 main questions I will try to reply in this blog post:
1.	Do Wealthy countries have less cases?
2.	Do Wealthy countries have less deaths?
3.	Do Wealthy countries have more vaccines? Did they have them earlier?

### Results
Wealthier countries reported a higher number of cases, deaths and vaccines. Furthermore, the wealthier the country, the earlier the vaccination processes started.

## Code

### Requirements
1. Python3
2. Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno, Plotly (if you miss any, you can pip install them)

### Files
The files contained in this repo are basically:
1. Blog post in PDF version
2. Readme
3. img folder containing few screenshots of the plots (output from the notebook, input for the blog)
4. Important note, the input datasets are read directly from the GitHub repository from Our World in Data, meaning that I do not hold/save the used files. If you want to run it, you can simple run it from your laptop and that would automatically read the latest data available from OWID.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) for making available such a complete, clean, updated and reliable data as they are doing with one of the most important topics of the world during the last year. \
Also many thanks for the Udacity Evaluation Team for providing very nice corrections/feedback to achieve results that exceed the requirements and help the projects outstand.
